/**
 * Dashboard rollups — Postgres port of firebase/functions/src/triggers/stats.ts,
 * DELIBERATELY SIMPLER than the Firestore version: Firestore couldn't afford a
 * live aggregate query (read pricing), so it maintained an incrementally-
 * folded `stats/daily/entries` cache with explicit at-least-once-delivery
 * dedup (`billIds`). Postgres can run the equivalent GROUP BY directly against
 * the indexed `bills` table in milliseconds at single-restaurant scale, so
 * there is no cache to keep consistent and therefore no double-count class of
 * bug to guard against — a genuine simplification, not a feature cut. Same
 * output contract (`rolling` shape) as the Firestore version; same fields
 * the dashboard already renders.
 *
 * Call `computeRolling()` after every bill-writing transaction commits (same
 * call site as `onBillWrite` triggered before) and on-demand from the
 * dashboard GET endpoint.
